Trip expense manager

This is an app to manage the expenses of a group after a trip or similar activity.
This uses features such as CursorLoader to interact with an SQLite database.
 Implements components like ListView which are actually a little outdated. You'd be better of using a RecyclerView and Android Jetpack components.
